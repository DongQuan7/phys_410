   Answer from paxdiablo

"You may find that you have to link with the math libraries on whatever system you're using, something like:

gcc -o myprog myprog.c -L/path/to/libs -lm
                                       ^^^ - this bit here."
   So what I did was, on Fedora 23 Linux

   gcc iteration1.c -lm
   
   and it worked

   Programming note:
   stdlib.h header has function exit
   function call exit(1) causes program to abort with an error status

   Sometimes, it's desirable to have a loop where test for continuation takes place
   at the END of each pass -> do-while statement, in general

   do statement while (expression);

   while and do-while statements are particularly well suited to looping situations 
   in which number of passes through loop is NOT known in advance

  Program to solve algebraic equation

   5      2
  x  + a x  - b = 0  

  by iteration. Easily shown that equation must have at least 
  one real root.  Coefficients a and b are supplied by user.

  Iteration scheme is as follows:

                  2  0.2
  x    = ( b - a x  )
   n+1            n

   where x_n is nth iteration.  User must supply initial guess for x.
   Iteration continues until relative change in x per iteration is 
   less than eps (user supplied) or until number of iterations exceeds
   NITER.  Program aborts if (b- a x*x) becomes negative.
