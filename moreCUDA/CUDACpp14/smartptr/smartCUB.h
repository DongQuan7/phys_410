 * Otherwise, I receive emails and messages on how all my (free) material on 
 * physics, math, and engineering have helped students with their studies, 
 * and I know what it's like to not have money as a student, but love physics 
 * (or math, sciences, etc.), so I am committed to keeping all my material 
 * open-source and free, whether or not 
 * sufficiently crowdfunded, under the open-source MIT license: 
 * 	feel free to copy, edit, paste, make your own versions, share, use as you wish.
